# project-1-31: MicroDonate
### Our app is hosted at https://micro-donate.herokuapp.com/

## What is MicroDonate?
MicroDonate is a platform that allows people to easily make a difference. Users of the application can quickly make small donations to causes that they care about, or offer their time in volunteering for different organizations with the click of a button. Organizations reach out directly to the site's founders to have their opportunities vetted and posted, and users can sign up or donate directly from our site.

## How does it work?
Users then gain experience points based on their contributions at a rate ascertained by the site administrators in conjunction with the participating organizations. These experience points provide users with 'levels'. Users' xp values are also posted on a "leaderboard," where users can compete to see who contributes the most in their community, and how far they have to go to catch up. Users are also able to leave comments/reviews on organizations to ensure trustworthiness of donations and efficacy of associated charities. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out by comment/email and in the meantime, thanks for using the site!

## Dashboard
This is the main dashboard of the website! Here you can see quick overview of your current XP level, donation opportunties, volunteering opportunities, and access a link that leads to the leaderboard. To view more about an opportunity, simply click on the 'donate' or 'volunteer' buttons listed next to each opportunity. 

## Details
This is the page accessible after clicking 'donate' or 'volunteer' under an opportunity. More information pertaining to the opportunity is listed at the top of the page. Clicking on the 'Go to Comments' button will let you view the comments that other users have left about that specific opportunity, as well as allow you to make your own comments as well.
### Donation
The donation details page includes a list of donors for that opportunity, as well as integrated Paypal API to donate easily using preset or custom donation amounts through Paypal or Credit/Debit. 
### Volunteering
The volunteering details page includes a list of volunteers currently signed up for the opportunity, the location of the opportunity, and a simple sign up button at the bottom of the page.

## Profile
The profile page allows users to view their current XP and level progress, as well as view what opportunities they have signed up for or donated to in the past. It is accessible through the top navigation bar at any time.

## Leaderboard
The leaderboard displays the top XP earners on our website sorted in descending order. Show off your philanthropic spirit to your friends! It is accessible through the top navigation bar as well as from the main dashboard.
